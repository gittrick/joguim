TFT (https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/) holds a special place in my heart as one of my favorite games. However, each new season brings about a challenge as the game introduces changes to the pieces and their optimal combinations. Leveraging my programming skills, I've devised a plan to create a code that will assist me in determining the most effective team composition based on the given pieces.
